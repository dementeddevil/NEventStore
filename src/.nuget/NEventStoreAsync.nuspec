    <description>The purpose of an Event Store is to represent a series of events as a stream.</description>
    <summary>
        NEventStoreAsync is a persistence agnostic event sourcing library for .NET and .NET Core. The primary use is most often associated with CQRS and event-sourcing.
        This project is heavily influenced by NEventStore however this library has been switched to utilise async programming practices where possible to allow better
        performance with persistence engines that also support async programming APIs (such as Azure Blob storage)
